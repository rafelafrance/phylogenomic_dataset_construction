The blastx output files must have a customized tubular output:
0-qseqid	1-qlen		2-seqid		3-slen		4-frame		5-pident
6-nident	7-length	8-mismatch	9-gapopen	10-qstart	11-qend
12-start	13-send		14-evalue	15-bitscore

Step 1: only look at HSPs that are long and sufficiently similar to the query
Step 2: check a block of HSPs from the a query-hit pair (hit_block) for self
chimeras
Step 3: check  a block of HSPs from the same query (query_block) for
multi-gene chimeras
		if no self chimera was detected. Out put two cut ranges with a and b
		after the names

output a ".cut" file for position to cut, and a ".info" file for validating
cuts

Modify the PIDENT_CUTOFF and LENGTH_CUTOFF as needed for each data set
The difference between "trans-multi" vs. "trans-self" is only meaningful when
the blast database is from a single species
